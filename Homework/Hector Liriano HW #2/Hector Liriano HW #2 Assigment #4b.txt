	b. if player chooses not to play, then game outputs how many
		   wins and loses the player had, and also how many times
		   the player switched or stayed.
	COMMENT: I would just like to add one thing- basically link the win/lose data
                 to the switch/stay data.  By that I mean output number of wins
                 when the player switched, number of wins when they stay, number of
                 loses when they switch, number of loses when they stay.
